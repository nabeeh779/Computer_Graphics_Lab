About the project:
	Exermote is a fitness app prototype, which is capable to detect Burpees, Squats and Situps and to count related repetitions.
	The exercise recognition is done with Convolutional LSTM Neural Networks.

About The Data:
	To recorde the data the programmer has used 2 different types of devices:
	- Iphone on right upper arm: 12 data features (3x gravity, 3x acceleration, 3x euler angle, 3x rotation rate).
	- 6x Estimote Nearables on chest, belly, hands and feet: each 4 data features (3x acceleration, 1x rssi)

	The Recording frequency was 10 Hz for the reason that Nearable send frequency is limited to this value on hardware side.

About the model training:
	The Programmer used DeepConvLSTM Neural Networks that were already tested by Francisco Javier Ordóñez and Daniel Roggen for recognizing activities of daily living.
	The model takes time sequences of raw sensor data and outputs the according exercise label.
	About the training:
		The whole training procedure took place in the google cloud, The machine learning framework in use was Keras with TensorFlow as backend.
