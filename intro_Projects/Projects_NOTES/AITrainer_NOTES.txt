About The Project:
	Simple AI trainer app using OpenCV Python and MediaPipe Python,
	It detects exercising-pose, which is given realtime, and counts prope" reps.
About The Data:
	Getting landmarks on the body using MediaPipe: Pose Estimation, Depending on the exercise chosen,
	 it calculates the angles between joints which actually matter ,It only counts "proper" reps, by checking the range of important angle.

About the model training:
	it is so simple the programmer used MediaPipe.
**MediaPipe offers cross-platform, customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media.**
